A process is a "running program" or "program in execution"

Processes have a variety of states:


   RUNNING           READY                 WAITING (on I/O)
    STATE            STATE                  STATE

   +-----+                              +-------------------------+
   |     |     +--------------------+   |                         |
   | CPU | <== | P3 | P6 | P5 | ... |   | I/O Subsystem           |
   | P22 |     +--------------------+   |                         |
   +-----+                              +-------------------------+


-- a CPU burst is a set of assembly instructions that are
    executed by the CPU for a given process (e.g., P22)

-- an I/O burst is one or more I/O operations for a given process


   RUNNING STATE: process is actually using the CPU
                   (i.e., executing its instructions)

   READY STATE: process is ready to use the CPU
                 (process is idle in the ready queue)

   WAITING STATE: process is waiting for I/O operation(s) to complete


-- CPU Scheduling (a.k.a. Short-Term Scheduling)

   The scheduling system enables one process to use the CPU
    while other processes are waiting in the ready queue to use
     the CPU (or waiting in the I/O Subsystem)

   The goals of CPU scheduling are to make efficient use of the CPU
    and to minimize the turnaround and wait times for each process

    -- we also want to achieve "fairness" across all processes
